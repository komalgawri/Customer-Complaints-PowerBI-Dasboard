- High number of complaints concentrated in specific product lines (e.g., Credit Cards & Loans).
- Web Chat and Phone channels receive the highest complaint traffic, indicating high-volume support demand.
- Certain regions show disproportionate complaint concentration, suggesting uneven service delivery.

**Impact:** Resourcing and process alignment required where volumes peak.

### **2️⃣ Resolution Performance**
- Average resolution time remains moderate overall but increases significantly for high-severity complaints and escalations.
- Resolution efficiency varies across channels and products, indicating workflow inconsistencies.

**Opportunity:** Standardize support workflows across high-volume complaint categories.

### **3️⃣ SLA Breach Patterns**
- SLA breach percentage is higher among specific product categories, especially where complaints are more complex.
- SLA breaches correlate with longer resolution times and high-severity cases.

**Risk Signal:** Certain processes may be underperforming operationally and need review.

### **4️⃣ Repeat Complaints (Customer Friction)**
- A noticeable portion of complaints are repeat issues (approx 10–20% based on segment).
- Repeat complaints are higher in channels that provide generic resolution (Web Chat).

**Insight:** First-contact resolution and knowledge accuracy must be improved.
